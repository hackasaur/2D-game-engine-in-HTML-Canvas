# 2D game engine in HTML5 Canvas
i'm building a game engine in HTML5 Canvas from scratch.

these are the basic features i hope to achieve:
- collision detection abiltiy for circle or rectangle bounding boxes
- physics for collisions, gravity, lights
- shaders for 2D world like dynamic shadows, shadows for arbitrary shapes
- texture loading for objects and ability to add animations and sounds
